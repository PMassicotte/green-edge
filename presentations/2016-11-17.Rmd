## GreenEdge physics paper

#### 2015

2015-04-01 to 2015-07-15

#### 2016

**Ship:** 2016-06-03 to 2016-07-04

**Ice camp:** 2016-05-01 to 2016-07-27

For a total of 194 sampling days!

## State of the atmosphere and ice

### What has been done

Data available daily:

- Cloud optical thickness (MODIS L3, resolution: 1 x 1 degree)
- Cloud fraction (MODIS L3, resolution: 1 x 1 degree)
- SST (AVHRR, resolution: 0.25 x 0.25 degree)
- Sea ice extent (NSIDC, resolution: 1 km)
- Sea ice concentration (AMSR2, resolution: 3.125 km)

## Sea Surface Temperature (SST)

## State of the atmosphere and ice

### What need to be done

- Wind speed (Eric is in contact with CONCEPTS GIOPS)
- Alternative: CCMP data (available daily at 0.25 x 0.25 degree resolution)

## CCMP data

> CCMP processing now combines Version-7 RSS radiometer wind speeds, QuikSCAT and ASCAT scatterometer wind vectors, moored buoy wind data, and ERA-Interim model wind fields using a Variational Analysis Method (VAM) to produce four maps daily of 0.25 degree gridded vector winds.
